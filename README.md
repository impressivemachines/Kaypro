## Kaypro Keyboard USB Interface

This project is about convering a retro Kaypro keyboard so that it can be plugged in to any computer via the USB port.

There are a lot of old Kaypro computers on eBay, and some keyboard only listings. The Keyboard uses a four wire interface and I have reverse engineered it. This project details the Kaypro keyboard comms format and also eventually will contain all the software to convert this to a USB device by interfacing it to an AVR USB-capable microcontroller.

Check the files for the interface spec.
